	<p>Fitness Tracker was founded in 2021, as a school collaborative project. The founders just don't want it to be a mundane tracker. They want you to grow in your journey and experience true joy into working out and athletics. The founders are self-proclaimed gym rats and they want you to carry that title as well. Since its birth, Fitness Tracker wants you to live longer, healthier, and happier lives. </p>
