    <h1>Timothy Jackson</h1>
      <p>My name is Timothy Jackson and I am a cadet at the Air Force Academy. I've played sports my whole life (track, basketball, football) and was recruited to play at the Air Force Academy. I broke a couple records and started for a few games but I am now retired. My major is computer science and a highlight of that is I recieved an A on a prolog program which I am proud of. The challenges of CompSci has caused a great frustration but also great joy in completing "impossible tasks". I still have trouble with malloc. Sports, friends, mentors, and school are the experiences that have taught me the most and made me the man I am today.</p>
